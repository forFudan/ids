# IDS of CJK characters for Yuhao Input Method (Yuniversus)

The progressive Ideographic Sequence Sequence (IDS) of CJK characters in this file is used to generate the divisons for [Yuhao Input Method (Yuniversus)](shurufa.app), a shape-based Chinese input method, that is able to input all CJK characters, radicals, strokes, Tangut, etc.

There are multiple columns, showing variations of different sources. The sources are listed as follows:

- G (People's Republic of China)
- T (Taipei Computer Association)
- H (Hong Kong SAR, PRC)
- J (Japan)
- K (Republic of Korea)
- V (Socialist Republic of Vietnam)
- U (Unicode Technical Comittee)
- S (SAṃgaṇikīkṛtaṃ Taiśotripiṭakaṃ, SAT)
- B (United Kingdom)
- M (Macau SAR, PRC)
- P (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)

The characters that are used in the IDS are from:

- CJK and all extensions.
- Strokes, radicals, and supplements.
- [Roots of Yuhao IME (Yuniversus)](https://shurufa.app/docs/yuniversus.html).

Due to special rules of Yuniversus that [the order of strokes is prioritized](https://shurufa.app/learn/division.html#符合笔顺)^[This is a common rule in other shape-based Chinese IME.], the descriptive characters `⿺`, namely "surround bottom and left side", is replaced by either `⿱` or `⿰`, for specific radicals, e.g, `辶𠃊`. Please be careful in such situations:

- `近 = ⿺辶斤` will be replaced by `⿱斤辶`.
- `亾 = ⿺𠃊人` will be replaced by `⿱人𠃊`.

You can very welcomed to use, distribute, or modify the IDS in this file. Let us work together to pass the Chinese culture down to the next generations.
